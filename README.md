# Ted-Easy-Downloader

### About
Groovy command line tool to download TED movies.  
'Ted' in Ted-Easy-Downloader means Ted-Easy-Downloader, of course, haha. 

### Prerequisites

- Groovy(including Grape)
- FireFox (You can change this with a small modification of code)

### Procedure

1. adjust config.json
2. exec ```groovy crawler.groovy``` to produce downloadList file
3. exec ```groovy downloader.groovy```

### Background
Now I'm traveling as a digital Nomad, using train(without WiFi) sometimes.  
So I made this tool to enjoy TED movies even on such offline environment as train.
